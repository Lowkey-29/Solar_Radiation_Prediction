# Solar_Radiation_Prediction


Using Machine Learning.


Conducted research to gather weather data and built a predictive model using machine learning algorithms; enabled grid operators to optimize solar power generation and improve efficiency.
•Developed a predictive model for solar radiation by collecting and analyzing past weather data of temperatures, wind speed, air and moisture, and implementing a solar irradiance forecasting algorithm; facilitated improved supply and demand management for grid operators.
•Libraries/ Tools - Python(Jupyter Notebook), Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Sklearn, Scipy, Scikit-Learn, Tensorflow, Xgboost.
